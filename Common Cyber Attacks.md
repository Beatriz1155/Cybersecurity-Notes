## Phishing & Spear Phishing
- Phishing is a social engineering attack in which an attacker impersonates a trusted entity to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information such as credentials or financial data. Spear phishing is a targeted version of phishing directed at specific individuals or organizations.

### How It Works
- Attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that mimic legitimate services. Victims are prompted to:
   - Click malicious links;
   - Download infected attachments;
   - Enter credentials into fake login pages.

Spear phishing typically uses personal or organizational information to increase credibility.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Suspicious sender domains;
- Unexpected password reset emails;
- Lookalike domains (e.g., micros0ft.com);
- Email headers showing spoofed origin;
- Multiple failed login attempts following email receipt.

### Detection Methods
- Email gateway filtering;
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation;
- User-reported suspicious emails;
- SIEM correlation of login anomalies.

### Mitigation Techniques
- Security awareness training;
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA);
- Email filtering solutions;
- Domain monitoring.
