# Definition of cybersecurity
- **Cybersecurity** is the discipline concerned with the protection of information systems, networks, devices, and data against unauthorized access, misuse, disruption, modification, or destruction.

# CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorizes access to data.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data is not altered.
- **Availability**: Ensuring data/services are accessible when needed.

# Threat vs Vulnerability vs Risk

- **Threat**: A **threat** is any potential cause of harm to a system, network or data, something that could exploit a weakness.
  It can be:
    - **Malicious** (hackers, malware, insider attacks);
    - **Accidental** (human error);
    - **Environmental** (fire, flood, power outage).
 
- **Vulnerability**: A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.
  Vulnerabilities may exist in:
    - **Software** (unpatched systems);
    - **Hardware**;
    - **Network configurations**;
    - **Human behavior** (weak passwords);
    - **Policies and procedures**.
  
- **Risk**: A **risk** is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
  Risk considers:
    - The likelihood of exploitation;
    - The potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability;
 
### Simple Comparison

| Term  | What it Represents | Key Question |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:
| Threat    | Potential cause of harm | What could attack us? |
| Vulnerability | Weakness     | Where are we exposed? |
| Risk     | Potential damage     | What happens if it succeeds? |

# Attack Surface
- The **attack surface** is the aggregate of all accessible attack vectors across hardware, software, network, and human components of an information system.

### Types of Attack Surface
1. **Digital Attack Surface**

2. **Physical Attack Surface**

3. **Human Attack Surface**
