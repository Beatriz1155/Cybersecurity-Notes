## Phishing & Spear Phishing
- Phishing is a social engineering attack in which an attacker impersonates a trusted entity to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information such as credentials or financial data. Spear phishing is a targeted version of phishing directed at specific individuals or organizations.

### How It Works
- Attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that mimic legitimate services. Victims are prompted to:
   - Click malicious links;
   - Download infected attachments;
   - Enter credentials into fake login pages.
Spear phishing typically uses personal or organizational information to increase credibility.
